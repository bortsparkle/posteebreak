# posteebreak
WordPress plugin to split plain text email posts from Postie into paragraph blocks

This is a very simple plugin that does only one thing.

When someone submits a plain text WordPress post through email with the Postie
Plugin, this plugin will break it up into paragraph blocks wherever there are
blank lines and leave everything else alone.
